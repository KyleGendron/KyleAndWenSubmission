# KyleAndWenSubmission
This is our complete submission regarding our Forest Fire simulation.  It contains our iPython Notebook in an approximated white paper format, a copy of all our plots and animations (in mp4 format), a copy of all our .pdf sources, a copy of our statistics, and a README to explain all the contents of the file -- although the notebook should also do so.

Things included in this repo:
  *The 6 issues are the images of our plots.
  *The notebook is our full project.
  
Since there is no way for me to link these items in this repo, all the rest of the contents will be in my Dropbox.  Send an email in order to receive a link for access to these files:
  *The 3 MP4 videos of our animations using each model.
  *The Excel document containing some compiled statistics regarding forest fires in California over the past 7 years.
  *The .pdf document for the Forestry Department Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations' study.
  
If I ever shell out the funds for a public account with Dropbox, the files are located here:

In this iPython Notebook, currently the "animate" method uses an FFMPEG-dependent function to generate .mp4 videos for the animation.  Coming soon will be an update to separate this type of animation from simply displaying a window showing the animation.  In the case that you'd like to use the animation with the FFMPEG-based function, a tutorial for it's installation (with dependencies) is here:
