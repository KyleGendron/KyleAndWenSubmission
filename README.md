# KyleAndWenSubmission
This is our complete submission regarding our Forest Fire simulation.  It contains our iPython Notebook in an approximated white paper format, a copy of all our plots and animations (in mp4 format), a copy of all our .pdf sources, a copy of our statistics, and a README to explain all the contents of the file -- although the notebook should also do so.
